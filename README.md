# Data Structures Lab Assignments
**Java 2 - Data Structures - Fall 2019 - CIS 2168**

These are labs assigned during my Data Structures course at Temple University. During this course, we learn more about Java, its 
data structures, and how to implement them. Throughout the course, we have learned about stacks, queues, recursion, maps, linked lists,
and more!

This course is definitely challenging but extremely important!

I hope you enjoy :)
